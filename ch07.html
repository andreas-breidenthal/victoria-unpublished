<p>The Churchill Archives sits at the edge of the city like a clean-lined fortress: glass, brick, restraint. Inside, the air smelled of polish and old paper. I signed the register, locked my bag, surrendered my pen for a pencil. Rules are rules. History doesn't forgive carelessness.</p>
<p>A trolley arrived with the first boxes. Not treasure &mdash; infrastructure. Letters on Murray's paper about length and tone. Benson's notes in a tidy hand. Slip after slip asking whether this or that paragraph &ldquo;tried the patience,&rdquo; whether &ldquo;domestics&rdquo; belonged in print, whether one could &ldquo;keep the constitutional thread clear.&rdquo; Nothing theatrical. No red ink. Just a method that never raised its voice.</p>
<p>I read fast, then slower. Correspondence sketched the shape of the work: how to memorialise without provoking; how to compress without unseating the image that was wanted; how to nudge the eye toward ministers and away from the rooms behind the doors. It wasn't the diary itself on the table. It was the apparatus that had decided what the diary was allowed to be.</p>
<p>By the second box my notebook was a list of categories, not quotes: domestic textures &mdash; compress or cut; female networks &mdash; peripheral, minimise; childbearing &mdash; unsuitable; political autonomy &mdash; keep the line of ministerial guidance. Nothing damning. Everything directional.</p>
<p>I returned the folders, signed out, and stepped into the pewter light. Next step: the Royal Archives and the Royal Collection Trust holdings &mdash; the strata the catalogues hinted at. I crossed the hedge line and saw the Audi half in shadow. Engine cold. Waiting.</p>
<p>I didn't pretend not to see him. I walked over and rapped the passenger window. &ldquo;Listen carefully,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If I see you again &mdash; even once &mdash; before we meet at the café on St. John's Lane, the meeting's off. No second chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A beat. Then a single nod. &ldquo;We do.&rdquo; The window rose. I watched the road until the car was gone, then put my hands in my pockets and walked toward the station.</p>
