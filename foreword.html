    <div class="body-text">
      <p>Between 1910 and 1912, Lionel Ashcombe removed a small set of typescript leaves from a waste bundle and later hid them in a cellar archive labelled <em>Miscellaneous Correspondence</em>. Each act was deliberate. Each was meant to keep the papers from vanishing.</p>

      <p>The materials include a working journal and a twelve-leaf transcript of Queen Victoria's diary for June&ndash;July 1837, over-written in pencil with editorial instructions and closed by a note in Esher's hand. They show not only what was written, but what was omitted.</p>

      <p>The documents are presented here in the order they were recovered. This sequence is deliberate. It reflects the unfolding of a record &mdash; not through narrative, but through recovery.</p>

      <p>I make no claims beyond what the paper can bear. The documents speak for themselves. Their internal consistency, their interlocking detail, and their quiet precision invite close reading. I invite you to approach them as you would any archive: with care, with curiosity, and with an awareness that the record is never complete.</p>
