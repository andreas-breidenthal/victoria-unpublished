<p>I cleared my desk and made it ordinary: no ink, unbuffered tissue, two small weights, the Temporary Custody form in sight &mdash; no copying, no publication, return on demand. Wrapper first. Then the twelve leaves, face-down to face-up, light, clean-cut wove. Each carried its graphite 1&ndash;12 in the top-right corner, steady as a metronome.</p>
<p>I didn't start with the words. I started with the object &mdash; leaf by leaf: edge nicks, old fold-memory eased, a faint pressure-shine where someone had once written on the page above. Then the lamp went to raking light, and the pencil came up out of the paper the way pencil does when you let it.</p>
<p>The hand in the margins didn't dither. It instructed. Short imperatives that match what the transcript is: the diary's living texture pared down for print. &ldquo;OMIT &mdash; criticism of ceremony.&rdquo; &ldquo;CONDENSE &mdash; domestic details/space.&rdquo; &ldquo;OMIT &mdash; ministerial dependence.&rdquo; &ldquo;OMIT &mdash; party management via Household; compromises Crown; assent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Names that once stood in the open were lifted into euphemism. Reliance was taught to sound like instruction. The pencil's weather moved across the days with professional calm.</p>
<p>At the back, after 13 July, the editor left his map. Esher's working note framed the hinge: <em>Household constituted; complexion conforms to Melbourne's Ministry. Removal complete. Melbourne effectively Private Secretary and Tutor; instruction proceeding. Public voice proved.</em></p>
<p>Then the dynamite. On the last leaf the typescript ran into a passage the pencil would not allow to live. In the middle, copied in her voice, the sentence that made sense of the rest &mdash; <em>no word shall be let out by me</em>. The margin directive beside it was blunt: &ldquo;OMIT &mdash; avowal of minister's role in Household; compromises Crown; pledge of secrecy.&rdquo; The promise, and the order to erase it, sleeping on the same page.</p>
<p>I put the leaves back in order and did the dull things that keep you honest. I locked the box. No triumph. Just responsibility.</p>
