<p>The National Gallery's memo template didn't care about adjectives, so I gave it what it wanted: Week 3 update filed; carrier ledgers cross-checked; Household equerry name corroborated in Round Tower warrants; no anomalies detected. Next steps: dealer correspondence; probate inventories; shipping manifests.</p>
<p>I hit send and closed the laptop. The job was doing what jobs do &mdash; moving forward in neat, numbered lines. The other thing wasn't.</p>
<p>I opened Ashcombe's journal again and turned to the entries I'd marked with a narrow paper slip. <em>&ldquo;Waste bundle for pulping &mdash; loose leaves, typescripts, a wrapper split. A few sheets slid free. I tucked them into my waistcoat.&rdquo; (27 July 1910)</em></p>
<p>Two years later he ties off the act: <em>&ldquo;Down in the cellars I slipped the twelve leaves into an archive marked Miscellaneous Correspondence. Between a sheaf of invoices and a letter about rum. No one will look there.&rdquo; (22 November 1912)</em></p>
<p>That was the route. Not romance &mdash; mechanics. Twelve leaves that escaped the mill, then disappeared into a label bland enough to survive tidying: <em>Miscellaneous Correspondence</em>.</p>
<p>Could any of it still exist? A century of moves and housekeeping said no. But Windsor had told me enough to know where <em>not</em> to look. If those leaves were ever to be found, they would be where Ashcombe left them &mdash; in a merchant cellar's archive, filed where no clerk had a reason to read.</p>
<p>I wrote two lists. One headed National Gallery &mdash; dealer daybooks, probate files, frame-maker directories. The other headed Berry Bros. &mdash; had the firm begun digitising its archives; where <em>Miscellaneous Correspondence</em> would surface on a cart; how close I could stand without getting in anyone's way.</p>
