<p>I thought the hard part would be finding it. I was wrong.</p>
<p>The packet is here. Twelve leaves, graphite numbers steady in the corners, the pencil's weather still visible under raking light. The thing I chased for months is now a quiet weight in a safe box. And with it comes the wisdom of a phrase I used to dismiss as melodrama: <em>be careful what you wish for.</em></p>
<p>Because now I'm in the same position Lionel Ashcombe was in &mdash; only with better lighting and a better hygrometer. He had a cellar and a conscience. I have a cupboard and a clock. The difference is that I know what happens when you hesitate: the paper goes to pulp, the story goes to fog, and the truth becomes a rumour no one can prove.</p>
<p>So the question is not <em>what have I found?</em> The question is <em>what do I do with it?</em></p>
<p>Three options present themselves, and none of them are clean: bury it deeper &mdash; that's what Ashcombe tried, and it didn't end well. Throw it to the wind &mdash; that would make me a vandal, not a custodian. Do the slow, dull, necessary thing: treat it as evidence, not ammunition. Transcribe it. Annotate it. Show the pencil for what it is: not drama, but design.</p>
<p>I choose the third. Not because it's safe &mdash; it isn't &mdash; but because it's the only way to keep the paper honest without turning it into theatre.</p>
<p>The field notes end here. What follows is the scholarly submission I prepared for publication: plain, procedural, and proportionate to the evidence. No page images. Typed transcripts. The pencil rendered exactly as it stands &mdash; [bracketed] &mdash; with my voice kept to the margins.</p>
<p>It proceeds in six parts. That is the shape. The duty is simple: stewardship over spectacle. The documents will do the talking.</p>
<p>And if they prove anything, it's this: silence isn't empty &mdash; it waits. I've kept it waiting long enough. Now it can speak.</p>
