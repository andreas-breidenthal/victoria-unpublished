<p>They gave me a lanyard, a locker, and the rules that matter: no ink, no scarves, no jewellery that can snag, no assumptions. Pencils only. Hands clean. If you find metal in paper, you don't be a hero &mdash; you call Conservation.</p>
<p>The project manager walked me through the run: intake &rarr; condition check &rarr; capture &rarr; metadata &rarr; QC &rarr; return. Tables in a long room, bright and even, cameras at their stations, grey cards and cradles set the way they should be.</p>
<p>First win came on something small, which is how it should be. A barcode didn't match the box list &mdash; numbers transposed in a scrawl. The operator was about to scan a folder labelled 1890 into a series that began 1909. It would have sailed through capture and created a ghost in the catalogue that would haunt someone else six months from now. I asked for the list, read it out loud back to front, and caught the twin digits where the handwriting drifted.</p>
<p>By mid-morning I'd seen enough to know where to stand. I moved to metadata prep, not at a screen but at the table. I wrote a one-page crib for dates and names and taped it to the edge of the desk: month forms the operators would meet in the wild, punctuation that trips search, how to record a dash so it sorts as a range and not as subtraction. The young operator opposite me tried it on the next stack and smiled without looking up. That's what you want &mdash; one less friction in a room built of frictions.</p>
<p>On the whiteboard, someone updated the schedule: <em>MISC. (pre-1914) &mdash; pending allocation.</em></p>
<p>I didn't react. I finished my batch, moved my chair to let a trolley pass, and wrote a note to myself on the corner of the QC sheet: <em>If &ldquo;pre-1914&rdquo; lands in intake, volunteer to shadow.</em> Not a plan. An available pair of hands.</p>
