<p>The café on St. John's Lane was half-empty, the hiss of the espresso machine filling the gaps in conversation. Mercer was already there, back to the wall, coat folded neatly on the chair beside him. He looked like a man who never had to hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Breidenthal.&rdquo; He stood as I approached, offered a hand. I ignored it and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;thanks for giving me the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He inclined his head. &ldquo;You made good use of it, I trust?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Which makes me wonder &mdash; why track me to Cambridge when we already had this meeting set?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mercer didn't flinch. &ldquo;Professional habit. We like to know where our interests are headed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stopped, the word hitting harder than I expected. &ldquo;Interests? Let's get something straight &mdash; I'm not a stock, and I'm not yours to manage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His smile thinned, but he didn't back down. &ldquo;Poor choice of words.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Perfect choice. Tells me exactly how you think. Here's how this works: you want a deal, you treat me like a partner, not an asset. Otherwise, we're done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pause. Then the smile returned, smooth as glass. &ldquo;Fair enough. Partners, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Access,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Introductions. Channels that open doors others can't.&rdquo; He let the words settle, then added, almost casually: &ldquo;We can open doors &mdash; even at Windsor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time, Mercer looked wrong-footed. &ldquo;I&hellip; assumed,&rdquo; he said, then caught himself. &ldquo;Given who I represent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who's that?&rdquo; He hesitated, then let it slip. &ldquo;The National Gallery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That landed like a stone in a still pond. Not just money &mdash; cultural authority. I kept my voice level. &ldquo;Never figured they'd care about what I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They care,&rdquo; Mercer said. &ldquo;More than you think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here's the deal: you get first look at anything Victorian and significant. But I work alone. I decide what's worth sharing. And if I think something shouldn't leave my hands, it doesn't.&rdquo; He nodded slowly. &ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside, the air was sharp with the promise of rain. I walked back toward the river, wondering if I'd just bought myself freedom &mdash; or a leash.</p>
