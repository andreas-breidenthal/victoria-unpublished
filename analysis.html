        <div class="section-head">Introduction</div>
        <p>This study examines two primary sources reproduced in full in this volume: the Ashcombe Journal (AJ, 1909&ndash;1913), which records the recovery in 1910 and concealment in 1912 of a set of typed leaves, and the Accession Typescript (AT) &mdash; a twelve-leaf typescript of Queen Victoria's diary for 20 June&ndash;13 July 1837, carrying a consistent run of pencilled editorial orders and closing with a terminal ESHER &mdash; working note. Together they form a small, coherent dossier: how the leaves survived, and what was done to their content.</p>
        <p>The research question is deliberately narrow: was any sanitising of the young sovereign's private notes during the accession weeks necessary &mdash; and, if so, to what extent? The method is evidential: read the pencil leaf-by-leaf &mdash; where it omits, condenses, or substitutes &mdash; and attend to pattern and timing rather than assertion.</p>
        <p>The significance lies in proximity to the formation of a public voice at a constitutional threshold. Orders that remove criticism of ceremony, compress domestic detail, suppress signals of ministerial dependence, and replace named Household particulars with a neutral cover phrase do more than tidy; they shape how accession is read. Publishing AT as a complete diplomatic transcript (DT-AT), alongside AJ's record of recovery and concealment, provides the base on which to consider the necessity (or not) and extent of sanitising.</p>

        <div class="section-head">Provenance and Physical Description</div>
        <p>This section describes the two sources at the level of material facts: paper, ink/typing, pencil, handwriting, wear, and concealment. No destructive testing has been undertaken; observations are visual and tactile (standard conservation lighting, raking light, magnification).</p>
        <p>The Ashcombe Journal is an octavo working notebook (approx. 200 &times; 130 mm), sewn gatherings in quarter-cloth over marbled boards; lined wove leaves. Entries are in iron-gall ink and graphite pencil. Hand is a tidy commercial clerk's cursive: compact loops, short ascenders, conventional figure forms. Two entries are decisive: 27 July 1910 (recovery of loose typed leaves from a waste bundle) and 22 November 1912 (placement of twelve leaves within a cellar series labelled <em>Miscellaneous Correspondence</em>).</p>
        <p>The Accession Typescript presents twelve separate leaves (approx. 255 &times; 205 mm) typed single-sided in black ribbon on wove paper; generous inner and outer margins (c. 25&ndash;30 mm). There are graphite annotations throughout: pencilled foliation [pencil &lt;1&gt;] &hellip; [pencil &lt;12&gt;]; margin orders rendered inline as [pencil: &hellip;]; and one terminal working note prefixed ESHER &mdash;.</p>
        <p>Orders are written in a calm, upright graphite hand. The ESHER &mdash; hinge is in the same medium, placed as a concluding direction. This edition records the ESHER &mdash; signature as an observable feature; it does not assert that every margin order was penned by Esher personally.</p>

        <div class="section-head">Contextual and Historical Background</div>
        <p>The two sources reproduced in this volume sit at the join between a private record and the making of a public one. AJ documents the recovery (1910) of a loose set of typed leaves from a waste bundle and their concealment (1912) inside a cellar series labelled <em>Miscellaneous Correspondence</em>. AT preserves a twelve-leaf typescript of diary entries for 20 June&ndash;13 July 1837 &mdash; the weeks of accession &mdash; bearing a consistent run of pencilled editorial orders and closing with a terminal line headed ESHER &mdash;.</p>
        <p>The accession weeks were dense with constitutional and presentational pressures: Proclamation, Privy Council, first ministerial audiences, and the first Household appointments. In that context, the pencil seen on AT is not casual correction but mediation: orders to omit criticism of ceremony, condense domestic detail, suppress signals of ministerial dependence, and substitute a neutral cover phrase for specific Household particulars.</p>
        <p>By the early twentieth century, the editorial treatment of Victoria's writings had become a formal enterprise, culminating publicly in <em>The Girlhood of Queen Victoria</em> (1912) and critically reassessed in modern scholarship.</p>

        <div class="section-head">Document Content and Internal Analysis</div>
        <p>Across DT-AT the pencil behaves as system, not tidy-up. Four recurrent actions define the programme:</p>
        <p><strong>1. Protecting ceremony from evaluation.</strong> Orders to omit quips or criticisms of ritual and pageantry (e.g., the Herald who &ldquo;swallowed&rdquo; titles). Effect: recodes ceremony as inviolable, shifting the voice from private reaction to neutral description.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Compressing domestic particulars.</strong> Repeated directives to condense or omit whole entries where the diary dwells on meals, walks, and quiet routine. Effect: reduces proximity and personal texture at the moment a public voice is being formed; distance increases.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Suppressing ministerial dependence.</strong> Recurring orders to omit phrasing that codes reliance on Melbourne or on instruction. Effect: erases tutelage from the page; agency shifts toward the sovereign.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Substituting particulars with a bland cover.</strong> Exemplar (AT, Leaf 6, 26 June): a named Household paragraph is deleted and replaced with [pencil: SUBSTITUTE &mdash; &ldquo;about my household, and various other confidential affairs.&rdquo;]. Effect: removes politically legible particulars (party complexion) and installs opacity under the language of confidentiality.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Frame-level control (the hinge).</strong> Exemplar (AT, Leaf 12, 13 July): the diarist's pledge &mdash; <em>I know it is dangerous to him, and no word shall be let out by me</em> &mdash; is deleted, followed by ESHER &mdash; Close here &hellip; Open new chapter with Friday, 14th July. Effect: editing reaches beyond sentences to chaptering; an accession voice is thus composed, not merely tidied.</p>
        <p>What is removed: ceremony-critique, domestic texture, named reliance, partisan particulars. What is installed: decorous tone, distance, neutral cover, and a frame that moves the reader past reliance to settled voice.</p>

        <div class="section-head">Corroboration and Comparative Evidence</div>
        <p>The Ashcombe Journal records the recovery (27 July 1910) of &ldquo;loose typed leaves&rdquo; from a waste bundle and their concealment as &ldquo;twelve leaves&rdquo; within a cellar series labelled Miscellaneous Correspondence (22 November 1912). The Accession Typescript presents twelve consecutively foliated leaves with no gaps or signs of re-ordering. AJ supplies the mechanics; AT supplies the marked content.</p>
        <p>The editorial logic visible on AT &mdash; omitting criticism of ceremony, condensing domestic detail, suppressing ministerial dependence, and substituting a neutral cover for Household particulars &mdash; is consonant with the shaping made public in <em>The Girlhood of Queen Victoria</em> (1912). Yvonne M. Ward's <em>Censoring Queen Victoria</em> argues that the editing of Victoria's writings was not incidental but structural &mdash; a programme that produced a sanitised public image. While Ward focuses on printed selections, her framing helps read AT as an unpublished witness to the same impulse.</p>
        <p>The digitised Queen Victoria's Journals provide a baseline for what was originally on the page. Where AT deletes Household particulars or ministers' roles, these witnesses can be checked to confirm presence or absence in the source tradition.</p>

        <div class="section-head">Interpretation and Implications</div>
        <p>The pencil's programme is deliberate and coherent. Its justifications &mdash; decorum, space, constitutional prudence, confidentiality &mdash; are the same justifications visible in published editorial practice. The question this edition poses is whether those justifications are sufficient for what was done.</p>
        <p>On the evidence of AT, a distinction can be drawn between sanitising that is limited and prudential (removing ceremony-criticism that could embarrass; compressing domestic detail that adds nothing to the public record) and sanitising that is more extensive (recoding named ministerial dependence as general instruction; substituting a neutral cover for politically legible Household particulars; and &mdash; most significantly &mdash; deleting the explicit pledge of silence that would, if known, have made the concealment of all the preceding edits visible).</p>
        <p>The shaped story is one of formation without dependence: the sovereign appears poised, not tutored; discreet, not complicit. Whether that shaping was necessary is a judgment this edition declines to make for the reader. It provides, instead, the evidence on which the judgment can rest.</p>
        <p>Deleting <em>&ldquo;no word shall be let out by me&rdquo;</em> is paradoxical: a promise of discretion is itself concealed, signalling a priority to avoid admitting that anything is withheld. &ldquo;Confidential affairs&rdquo; presents secrecy as respectable, but it blocks inference where politics would otherwise show.</p>

        <div class="section-head">Conclusion</div>
        <p>The Accession Typescript and the Ashcombe Journal together constitute a small, coherent evidential pair: a provenance witness and a marked text. The pencil on AT is not incidental; it is programmatic. The programme is legible, proportionate in some places, and more than proportionate in others. The contribution of this edition is to place that evidence on the record so that debate about the necessity (or not) and extent of sanitising rests on what the pages show, not on assertion.</p>
        <p>Further work is straightforward to define: material tests (transmitted/reflective light; multispectral imaging); comparative hands and process (side-by-side comparison of the AT margin hand with controlled samples from the Esher Papers); source concordance (systematic checks against digitised Victoria journals); and custody documentation (finalise the Temporary Custody and Transfer of Physical Custody instruments).</p>
        <p>The contribution of this edition is to place one coherent span of evidence on the record &mdash; AJ's mechanics and AT's pencil &mdash; so that debate about the necessity (or not) and extent of sanitising rests on what the pages show, not on assertion.</p>
