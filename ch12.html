<p>The meeting room at the National Gallery looked temporary and expensive, the way pop-up rooms do. Mercer stood when I walked in. The woman beside him didn't. She had a folder and a pen and a way of not smiling that said she worked with problems, not people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Head of Collections,&rdquo; she said. No name. Just the job.</p>
<p>I sat. &ldquo;You wanted my ear.&rdquo; &ldquo;We want your eye,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We're mounting a show on Victoria's early reign. One centrepiece has a pause in the paperwork &mdash; 1838 to 1840. It's not fatal, but it's a weakness. Our lenders and counsel will sleep better if that seam is stitched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Type of object?&rdquo; &ldquo;A court portrait.&rdquo; She glanced at the folder. &ldquo;Attribution is sound. Movement in the early years is not. There's a family note &mdash; useless. A dealer ledger &mdash; partial. Then nothing. The first solid record is later than we'd like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you need it closed before the press view,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Before the facility reports start circulating,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Rumours travel faster than trucks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you tried?&rdquo; &ldquo;The formal routes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Auction archives, dealer archives, Art Loss register, family papers, two county records offices, three private curators, and a junior who can read six kinds of Victorian hand and hates us for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scope?&rdquo; &ldquo;Eight weeks,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Earlier if you can. Written updates every fortnight. Paper trails only &mdash; no heroics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded and let the room go quiet. &ldquo;I need forty-eight hours,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;To map the route and price the risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She closed the folder. &ldquo;You have it. And Mr Breidenthal &mdash; no shopping lists. We don't want to know how you work, only what you find.&rdquo;</p>
