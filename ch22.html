<p>I was in ten minutes before the lift. The room woke in stages: lights; a monitor glow; the dry click of a barcode gun checking its own pulse.</p>
<p>At eight-thirty the doors opened, and the pre-1914 trolley arrived &mdash; two tiers, packets stacked like careful bread. The top slip read <em>MISC. (pre-1914)</em> in the same lazy hand as yesterday.</p>
<p>The third packet came up with a label that didn't want to say anything. <em>Misc. Corr. &mdash; Various (pre-war)</em>, the modern type said. Under it, erased hard, the older line showed if you leaned it to the light: <em>Miscell. &mdash; Non-trade (letters)</em>. The outer folder was standard. Inside, halfway down, sat a secondary wrapper &mdash; not house stock, not trade, too stiff for these shelves &mdash; tied once with old cotton and tucked flat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold,&rdquo; I said, and the operator froze the way good hands freeze: everything where it is, nothing strained.</p>
<p>I untied the cotton and eased the wrapper open. Inside: a thin sheaf without company stationery, no docketing, no trade headings. Typescript &mdash; later than the ledgers around it &mdash; scored over in pencil that didn't belong to an office. The top right of the first leaf carried a single &ldquo;1&rdquo; in graphite. The twelfth &mdash; because there were twelve &mdash; carried &ldquo;12.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn't read. I looked. Wove paper; no house forms; no inward/outward marks. Margins carried instructional pencil &mdash; decisive, not hesitant. The headings gave the window: June&ndash;July 1837.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Non-trade by content and medium,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Reads like an amateur editorial pastiche &mdash; pseudo-documentary voice. Out of scope for this series. Low risk: no PII, no suppliers, no pricing, no BBR letterhead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The client archivist wrote in the incident book &mdash; neat, unfussy. We followed the protocol. No leaf photography. No content images. The archivist said it again for the log: &ldquo;No page-level capture authorised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slid a form toward me. &ldquo;TCI. Fourteen days, no publicity, no page-level imaging, preserve and return on demand, no title conveyed.&rdquo; I read, signed, dated.</p>
<p>At the door, the evening felt ordinary on purpose. In the bag, the weight wasn't heavy. It was exact.</p>
