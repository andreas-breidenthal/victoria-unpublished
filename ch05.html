<p>I ordered the book that night &mdash; <em>The Girlhood of Queen Victoria</em>. A few clicks, a second-hand copy from a dealer in Kent. Delivery in two days. That gave me time to keep working the circuit &mdash; sales, auctions, charity shops. The rhythm of my life.</p>
<p>The next morning, I drove out to a village hall sale. The usual mix: chipped china, hymnals, boxes of paper gone soft at the edges. I was halfway through a stack of ledgers when I felt it &mdash; that prickle at the back of the neck. I looked up. Through the window, across the car park, an Audi idled in the shade of a sycamore. Same car. Same man.</p>
<p>By the time the book arrived, I was ready for something solid. The parcel was on the mat when I got home &mdash; brown paper, string, the dealer's label in a spidery hand. I slit it open and held the volume like a relic. Esher's name on the spine. The man who decided what the world was allowed to read.</p>
<p>I turned to the section Ashcombe had circled in his mind &mdash; the summer of 1837, the first weeks of a reign. In Esher's edition, they were polished to glass: <em>&ldquo;about my household, and various other confidential affairs.&rdquo;</em> That was it. No lists of names. No candid lines about Melbourne's hand in the appointments. No pledge of silence. Just a phrase so bland it could have been written by a clerk.</p>
<p>I closed the book and opened my laptop. Typed the name I'd written in my notebook: Esher. His papers &mdash; journals, correspondence, drafts &mdash; are at the Churchill Archives Centre, Cambridge. Appointment required.</p>
<p>I booked one for the following week.</p>
<p>When I shut the laptop, the room was quiet. Too quiet. I crossed to the window and looked down at the street. Empty, except for a dark Audi parked two doors down. Engine off this time. Waiting.</p>
