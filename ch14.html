<p>Legal tidied the commas. The emails came through in the right order: the scope letter, the timetable, the confidentiality, the references promised &ldquo;by week's end,&rdquo; and the line that mattered &mdash; the National Gallery would sponsor Windsor. That would take time. I didn't have to wait to begin.</p>
<p>I asked for fresh images of the picture's back &mdash; verso, frame, stretcher &mdash; and opened them one by one. Old frames confess more than forewords. Three labels, none generous. The newest had a telephone number that put it in the twentieth century. The oldest was thin stock, a rectangle with a ghosted oval where a seal had once been; enough ink survived to suggest a workshop and a district, but not a name.</p>
<p>Labels lie by omission, not commission. I listed what could be known without guessing: paper weight, cut, the way the adhesive bled into the grain, the faint track of a knife where someone had lifted a corner and thought better of it. Then I built a map that began where such things usually begin &mdash; framers &mdash; and ran outward.</p>
<p>Daybooks next. One notice half a century later repeated the title with a date that didn't belong &mdash; &ldquo;after 1838&rdquo; &mdash; the sort of confident error that tells you where the picture once sat on a wall and how long it sat there.</p>
<p>One line felt warmer than the rest: an invoice book that had survived a move and a flood, the ink uneven but legible enough to carry a balance due. &ldquo;Portrait &mdash; frame and glass.&rdquo; No artist named. The payer described, not identified: &ldquo;Equerry to Her Majesty.&rdquo; The date put it in the back half of 1838.</p>
<p>I laid the facts in a memo &mdash; facts first, adjectives later &mdash; and sent it to the National Gallery. Their reply was quick and tidy: thank you, proceed &mdash; with the tone of a room that had other fires to put out.</p>
