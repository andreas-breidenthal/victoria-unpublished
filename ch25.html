<p>Legal likes clear paper and tidy verbs. The email arrived late morning: approved. The archivist brought the form up after lunch &mdash; no ceremony, just the weight of what it allowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Transfer of physical custody,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No warranties. No publicity during the 325th. Copying and transcription permitted for preservation and research; no page-image publication during the embargo. Conserve. If custody ever changes, tell us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We stood at the bench we'd used for nothing more consequential than a torn docket last week. I read the lines once, then again, then signed where people sign when they mean to be believed. She countersigned, stamped, and slid the sheet into a folder that had been waiting before I knew I was coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep them properly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She left the room the way good archivists always leave rooms &mdash; without moving the air.</p>
<p>Work went on. Intake breathed, QC ticked, the crib under the desk edge grew a shade greyer. I finished the debrief I'd been writing in the margins of days. The project manager read it standing up. &ldquo;We can extend,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You don't need me to sit here,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If a miscellaneous starts behaving like a story, call me.&rdquo; She almost smiled. &ldquo;We'll call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At home, I set the signed transfer beside the safe box and made the catalogue whole. The packet lay flat in its four-flap, the graphite numerals steady in the top corners as if they had always been there waiting for today. I checked the hygrometer, nudged the silica, and wrote one small line on the stewardship card I'd left in the box: <em>Status: held.</em></p>
<p>Not triumph. Not relief. Something quieter &mdash; custody without theatrics. A small thing that would have been pulped, then smothered, now living in the exactness of sleeves and air and a ledger that tells the truth about where it is.</p>
