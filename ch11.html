<p>Mercer's email landed mid-morning. No subject line, just two sentences: <em>Client is available next week. Confirm if you're ready to meet.</em></p>
<p>The National Gallery. That name still sat like a weight in my mind. Not a collector, not a dealer &mdash; an institution. A name that could open doors, and not just to vaults of paintings. But why me? Why Victorian scraps and clearance-sale boxes? What did they think I could give them that they couldn't buy ten times over at auction?</p>
<p>I typed a reply, then deleted it. Typed another. Deleted that too. Finally, I wrote: <em>Confirm. Name the time and place.</em></p>
<p>I hit send and sat back, the weight of it settling in my chest. This wasn't just about a deal anymore. It was about leverage &mdash; who had it, who didn't, and how long I could keep mine.</p>
<p>I opened Ashcombe's journal again, the same lines staring back like a dare: <em>&ldquo;Twelve leaves covering twenty-four days after the accession &mdash; 20 June to 13 July 1837. The days are ordinary, which is why they matter.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Twenty-four days. A formation, not a flourish: the Household made to match the Whigs; the reliance named; the pledge of silence. If those leaves hold, they don't just tweak a page &mdash; they change the frame. And until I'm inside the Round Tower, the originals stay where they are: still locked away. Still out of reach.</p>
<p>If the National Gallery wanted something from me, I needed to know what they valued &mdash; and why. And if Mercer thought he was the only one playing a long game, he was wrong.</p>
