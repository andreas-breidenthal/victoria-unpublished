<p>The Royal Archives website looked as polished as the Round Tower it lived in &mdash; formal, immaculate, and faintly intimidating. I scrolled through the access page twice before I started drafting my email. Keep it vague, I told myself. &ldquo;Research into Victorian editorial practices.&rdquo; That sounded safe enough. I hit send and waited.</p>
<p>The reply came the next morning. Polite, precise, and about as welcoming as a locked gate: access is granted at the discretion of the Keeper on behalf of His Majesty; a detailed proposal required; two academic references; security clearance; several weeks to process; approval not guaranteed; photography prohibited.</p>
<p>I read it twice, then leaned back in my chair. A detailed proposal. References. Security checks. Weeks of waiting. And even then, no guarantee. If I told them what I was really after, they'd shut the door before I reached the moat.</p>
<p>I opened Ashcombe's journal again, thumbing through the pages I'd marked. The fragments stared back at me: <em>&ldquo;Heard Esher say, lightly: &lsquo;We shape memory.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em> <em>&ldquo;Twelve leaves covering twenty-four days after the accession &mdash; 20 June to 13 July 1837.&rdquo;</em> <em>&ldquo;The days are ordinary, which is why they matter.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I closed the journal and stared at the ceiling. The Royal Archives were the only place the originals could be &mdash; but getting in would take time I didn't have. Mercer was waiting. Thursday was coming. And if he guessed what I was chasing, the game would change.</p>
<p>For now, I needed another way forward. If I couldn't reach the pages, I'd start with the world they came from.</p>
