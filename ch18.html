<p>I closed the National Gallery job the way I like to close jobs &mdash; quietly. The provenance memo ran to three pages: ledger, carrier, warrants; the equerry's name where it needed to be; a chain that wouldn't wobble when counsel pressed it. Facts first, adjectives later.</p>
<p>Mercer read it standing up. &ldquo;This will hold,&rdquo; he said, and meant it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;One more favour.&rdquo; He tilted his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're cross-wiring with Berry Bros. for '23,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Someone is also moving their archive through a camera right now or has just finished doing it. If you know the vendor &mdash; or if the vendor knows you &mdash; put me in a room with them for ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To do what?&rdquo; &ldquo;To make them faster,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;They'll be drowning in miscellaneous. I'm good at pulling signal out of boxes that say they don't have any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever is actually digitising,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You'll have a name in your calendar invites. I'll take a short contract &mdash; metadata triage, anomaly QC, misfile detection. Throughput without drama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He watched me for a moment, weighing risk against inconvenience. &ldquo;And why,&rdquo; he said, mildly, &ldquo;am I doing this for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it helps you,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;They want clean stories in '23. Better metadata now means fewer last-minute fires later. And because I've delivered everything you asked for, inside the time, without noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled, thin and real. &ldquo;Five minutes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If they like you, it's theirs to take.&rdquo; &ldquo;That's all I need.&rdquo;</p>
