<p>The National Gallery liked meetings that started on time and ended before anyone got comfortable. This one ran to type: a room, a screen, a list. I gave my two minutes &mdash; carrier ledger aligned; equerry presence corroborated; next steps in hand &mdash; and slid back into the quiet.</p>
<p>They moved to publicity. A donor supper. A lenders' breakfast. Then the curator said, almost as an aside, &ldquo;We're pacing the press cycle to play nicely with St James's &mdash; Berry Bros. &amp; Rudd have their 325th in 2023. Short films, anniversary content. That part of town will be noisy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one in the room cared about noise. I did. Noise pulls old paper into daylight.</p>
<p>Anniversaries need stories; stories need pictures; pictures need archives. If Berry Bros. were planning 2023, the groundwork would happen now, not later &mdash; catalogues squared, sequences named, &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; taught to behave. You don't open the doors to history unless you've had people in gloves there a year or more ahead.</p>
<p>Two thoughts arrived together. If their archive was already in the cradle, <em>Miscellaneous Correspondence</em> might be passing across a cart this week. Or the project might be further along than I hoped, with misfiled leaves already tidied into oblivion. The window wasn't open. It was moving.</p>
<p>Back in the meeting I asked a question that sounded like logistics. &ldquo;Do we have any cross-programme dependencies with Berry Bros.? If the area is active ahead of 2023, shipping might want a heads-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Head of Collections nodded. &ldquo;We're coordinating diary noise. Berry Bros. film agency is talking to our comms. Why?&rdquo; &ldquo;Just making sure I don't put a van in someone's frame,&rdquo; I said, and let it go.</p>
<p>The National Gallery would get what it needed. That was the work. The other thing would have to live between the lines, paced to someone else's celebration.</p>
