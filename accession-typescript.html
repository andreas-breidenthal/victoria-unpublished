            <span class="ts-date"><em>Tuesday, 20th June. &mdash;</em></span>
            <p class="ts-text">I was awoke at 6 o&rsquo;clock by Mamma, who told me that the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here, and wished to see me. I got out of bed and went into my sitting-room (only in my dressing-gown), and alone, and saw them. Lord Conyngham (the Lord Chamberlain) then acquainted me that my poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes p. 2 this morning, and consequently that I am Queen. Lord Conyngham knelt down and kissed my hand, at the same time delivering to me the official announcement of the poor King&rsquo;s demise. The Archbishop then told me that the Queen was desirous that he should come and tell me the details of the last moments of my poor, good Uncle&thinsp;; he said that he had directed his mind to religion, and had died in a perfectly happy, quiet state of mind, and was quite prepared for his death. He added that the King&rsquo;s sufferings at the last were not very great but that there was a good deal of uneasiness. Lord Conyngham, whom I charged to express my feelings of condolence and sorrow to the poor Queen, returned directly to Windsor. I then went to my room and dressed.</p>
            <p class="ts-text">Since it has pleased Providence to place me in this station, I shall do my utmost to fulfil my duty towards my country&thinsp;; I am very young and perhaps in many, though not in all things, inexperienced, but I am sure, that very few have more real good will and more real desire to do what is fit and right than I have.</p>
            <p class="ts-text">Breakfasted, during which time good faithful Stockmar came and talked to me. Wrote a letter to dear Uncle Leopold and a few words to dear good Feodore. Received a letter from Lord Melbourne in which he said he would wait upon me at a little before 9. At 9 came Lord Melbourne, whom I saw in my room, and of course quite ALONE as I shall always do all my Ministers. He kissed my hand and I then acquainted him that it had long been my intention to retain him and the rest of the present Ministry at the head of affairs, and that it could not be in better hands than his. He then again kissed my hand. He then read to me the Declaration which I was to read to the Council, which he wrote himself and which is a very fine one. I then talked with him some little longer time after which he left me. He was in full dress. I like him very much and feel confidence in him. He is a very straightforward, honest, clever and good man. I then wrote a letter to the Queen. At about 11 Lord Melbourne came again to me and spoke to me upon various subjects. At about &frac12; p. 11 I went downstairs and held a Council in the red saloon. I went in of course quite alone, and remained seated the whole time. My two Uncles, the Dukes of Cumberland and Sussex, and Lord Melbourne conducted me. The declaration, the various forms, the swearing in of the Privy Councillors of which there were a great number present, and the reception of some of the Lords of Council, previous to the Council in an adjacent room (likewise alone) I subjoin here.</p>

            <p class="ts-text">I was not at all nervous and had the satisfaction of hearing that people were satisfied with what I had done and how I had done it. Receiving after this, Audiences of Lord Melbourne, Lord John Russell, Lord Albemarle (Master of the Horse), and the Archbishop of Canterbury, all in my room and alone. Saw Stockmar. Saw Clark, whom I named my Physician. Saw Mary. Wrote to Uncle Ernest. Saw Ernest Hohenlohe who brought me a kind and very feeling letter from the poor Queen. I feel very much for her, and really feel that the poor good King was always so kind personally to me, that I should be ungrateful were I not to recollect it and feel grieved at his death. The poor Queen is wonderfully composed now, I hear. Wrote my journal. Took my dinner upstairs alone. Went downstairs. Saw Stockmar. At about 20 minutes to 9 came Lord Melbourne and remained till near 10. I had a very important and a very comfortable conversation with him. Each time I see him I feel more confidence in him&thinsp;; I find him very kind in his manner too. Saw Stockmar. Went down and said good-night to Mamma &amp;c. My dear Lehzen will ALWAYS remain with me as my friend but will take no situation about me, and I think she is right.</p>

            <p class="ts-text">Got up at 8. At 9 we all breakfasted. At &frac12; p. 9 I went to St. James&rsquo;s in state. Mamma and Lady Mary Stopford were in my carriage, and Lord Albemarle, Col. Cavendish, Lady Flora Hastings, and Col. Harcourt in the others.

            After the Proclamation Mamma and the ladies repaired to an adjoining room and left me in the Closet. I gave audiences to Lord Melbourne (a long one), the Earl Marshal (Duke of Norfolk), and Garter King at Arms (Sir John Woods), relative to the funeral of my poor Uncle the late King&thinsp;; to Lord Albemarle, Lord Hill, Lord Melbourne (again for some time), and the Lord President (Lord Lansdowne). I then held a Privy Council in the Throne Room.</p>

            <span class="ts-date"><em>Thursday, 22nd June. &mdash;</em></span>
            <p class="ts-text">Got up after 8. After 9 we breakfasted. The children played in the room. At a &frac14; p. 10 I walked out with Mary, Lehzen, Charles and Edward, and came home at 20 minutes to 11. Wrote to the Duchess of Gloucester. Wrote my journal. At 12 came the Judge Advocate General (Mr. Cutlar Ferguson) to submit various sentences of Court Martial to me. He is a very clever intelligent man and explained all the cases very clearly to me. I, of course, saw him alone.
            <span class="deletion-block"><span class="deleted">After 1 we lunched; I had some cold chicken and strawberries which were very fine. At a little p. 2 I wrote a few lines to Aunt Sophia and sealed them with the little seal with the rose. Walked again for a few minutes in the garden; the sun was warm; Dash chased a butterfly and was very merry. Looked at the geraniums which are much improved; the gardener brought me a small nosegay of pinks. At a &frac14; p. 3 came Lady Catherine for a moment with patterns for gowns; I chose the pale blue ribbon with the narrow edging, which I like. Tried on my new shoes; they pinched me a little at the heel, and I desired they should be stretched. Sat a few minutes with Lehzen; she told me of Charles&rsquo;s great joy about a new top; I laughed very much. At 4 we had a little tea; Mary played with the children at building a small fort with the cushions. I looked over some small prints of Windsor which I arranged in my book; I drew a tiny spray of rose to place by them. At a little before 6 I walked in the corridor; the air from the open window was very pleasant and there were pretty clouds in the west. At 7 we dined. Afterwards I sang a little with Mary, but my voice was not good to-day. I wrote a line to Feodore to send some remembrance, and to thank her for her kind letter. Stayed up till a &frac14; p. 10 reading some pages in Scott.</span></span>

            <p class="ts-text">Got up after 8. At &frac12; p. 9 we all breakfasted. The children played in the room. Wrote a letter to the Duke of Sussex, and to good Sp&auml;th. At 11 came Lord Melbourne and stayed till 12. He is a very honest, good and kindhearted, as well as very clever man. He told me that Lady Tavistock had accepted the situation. And he read to me the answer which I was to give to the address from the House of Lords. I really have immensely to do&thinsp;; I receive so many communications from my Ministers but I like it very much.
            <span class="deletion-block"><span class="deleted">I am daily more sensible of Lord Melbourne&rsquo;s quiet kindness; he never hurries me, and after he has been I am more at ease. He said he would send me some papers to look at to-morrow, and come again on Monday.</span></span>

            <p class="ts-text">Got up at 8. At &frac12; p. 9 we breakfasted. The children played in the room. At 10 I went down to prayers with Mamma, Mary, Lehzen, and Charles. The service was read by the Dean who was much affected when he read the prayers in which my name is now mentioned in the place of my poor Uncle, the late King. He preached a very good and appropriate sermon.
