          <span class="entry-date">14 October 1909 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">A new book begun. The last volume (1907&ndash;09) is full and shelved with the others. Money low. Work none. Rain all day.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">16 October 1909 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Answered two advertisements: copying work; clerks wanted. Nothing likely.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">20 October 1909 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Walked to the registry office. My boots leak. The clerk took my particulars and said there is little call for men like me &ldquo;at present.&rdquo;</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">27 October 1909 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Sold the good umbrella. Kept the pen.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">31 October 1909 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Quiet streets. I wrote to her &mdash; kept it short.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">2 November 1909 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Still no work. Funds running low. If nothing turns, I may have to leave these lodgings.</span>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">9 November 1909 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Wrote to three firms. The landlord allows a week's grace.</span>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">18 November 1909 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Saw an advertisement in the <em>Morning Post</em>: &ldquo;Assistant required for confidential literary work.&rdquo; Applied at once. Perhaps fortune turns.</span>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">1 December 1909 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Application accepted. To Windsor next week. They say the gentleman is Lord Esher. I wonder if this will be the making of me.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">8 December 1909 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Moved to smaller rooms near Victoria Station. Damp walls, but cheap. I miss the old place. Wrote to her &mdash; no reply.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">15 December 1909 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">First impressions: Esher is all polish and command. Speaks as if the world were his committee. I fetch proofs, log letters, keep the fire stoked.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">6 January 1910 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Kensington papers in; Windsor packets out. They call them &ldquo;the girlhood journals.&rdquo; I carried a parcel as if it were glass.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">10 January 1910 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">I glimpsed a sheet &mdash; her hand neat as pins. They say she began at thirteen and kept it daily. Better than I could ever do.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">21 January 1910 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Workmanlike morning. Afternoon of sorting. Many fair copies carry small pencil strokes in the margin &mdash; economies for &ldquo;space.&rdquo;</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">5 February 1910 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Wet and wind. A clerk chuckled over a line about shoes pinching. The pencil beside it reads: <span class="margin-note">OMIT &mdash; space / trifles</span> Odd to strike out such harmlessness.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">14 February 1910 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Rain again. Walked to the station for a parcel and thought of her. I wonder if she kept the little book I gave her. Foolish. More &ldquo;space&rdquo; cuts today: ribbons, a dog in the garden, a remark about prints.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">1 March 1910 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">A note circulated: &ldquo;Maintain tone.&rdquo; Another: &ldquo;Domestic detail to be judicious.&rdquo; The pile of struck leaves grows.</span>

          <span class="entry-date">9 March 1910 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Changed lodgings &mdash; closer to the office. The landlady is kind enough. I miss the quiet of Croydon. London presses in like a tide.</span>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">31 March 1910 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Heard Esher say, lightly: &ldquo;We shape memory.&rdquo; As if truth were clay.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">23 April 1910 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">A margin reads: <span class="margin-note">OMIT &mdash; criticism of ceremony</span> I only saw the tail of it &mdash; something about a herald swallowing her style and titles. Why cut that?</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">7 May 1910 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Edward VII is dead. Streets hushed like a church. I remember Victoria&rsquo;s Diamond Jubilee bonfires in &rsquo;97 &mdash; how the sky in Croydon burned red and we cheered ourselves hoarse.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">15 June 1910 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">More pencil: <span class="margin-note">OMIT &mdash; quotation / space</span> Scruple over space, or something else?</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">21 July 1910 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">A sharper hand now appears in the margins: <span class="margin-note">OMIT &mdash; ministerial dependence / compromises Crown</span> Not trifles. I turn the leaf back the moment footsteps sound.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">27 July 1910 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Waste bundle for pulping &mdash; loose leaves, typescripts, a wrapper split. A few sheets slid free. I tucked them into my waistcoat and moved on.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="discovery-block">
          <p>In my room, I laid them out: twelve leaves covering twenty-four days after the accession &mdash; 20 June to 13 July 1837. The days are ordinary, which is why they matter.</p>
          <p>The pencil speaks plainly:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>OMIT &mdash; party management via Household; compromises Crown; assent.</li>
            <li>OMIT &mdash; ministerial dependence / compromises Crown.</li>
            <li>OMIT &mdash; whole entry; space / domestic particulars.</li>
            <li>OMIT &mdash; from &lsquo;I sometimes think&rsquo; to end; morbid reflection / decorum.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>And at the end, a working note mapping a chapter break: Household now constituted; complexion conforms to Melbourne&rsquo;s Ministry. Melbourne, in effect, acts as Private Secretary and Tutor; political schooling begun; public voice proved. Divide for phases.</p>
          <p>Most arresting of all is a line in the Queen&rsquo;s own hand about her Household: thanking Lord Melbourne for helping set it in order; knowing it is dangerous to him; promising no word shall be let out. The pencil beside it is unequivocal: <span class="margin-note">OMIT &mdash; avowal of minister&rsquo;s role in Household; compromises Crown; pledge of secrecy</span></p>
          <p>Very interesting. I feel I have stumbled into a room where history whispers behind closed doors.</p>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">14 August 1910 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">I have read the twelve leaves three times. What seemed harmless &mdash; ribbons, shoes, the dog &mdash; was a screen. The real cutting is elsewhere: the Household made to match the Whigs, the reliance on Melbourne named, the pledge of silence.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-text">If this were known, the beginning would read differently. And later &mdash; when Peel made the Bedchamber a condition of office in 1839, and Melbourne stood behind the Queen &mdash; how sharp the irony would bite.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">7 September 1910 &mdash;</span>

          <span class="entry-date">22 October 1910 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Wrote to her &mdash; no reply. I am not attending as I should at work. Twice today I mislaid a docket.</span>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">6 January 1911 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Snow on the sill. I copied names till my fingers cramped. A clerk joked that I court penance. The joke landed.</span>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">22 June 1911 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Coronation of George V. Flags everywhere. I watched the procession at the edge of the crowd and thought of her. And of the girl in the leaves who walked from Kensington into office and men.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">6 July 1911 &mdash;</span>

          <span class="entry-date">12 July 1911 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Dismissed. &ldquo;Reduction.&rdquo; Perhaps they guessed my curiosity. Perhaps not. I wrapped the leaves tighter and went out into the heat.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">6 October 1911 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">I wish things had worked out as we planned&hellip; but she is gone now. I cannot write more of it here.</span>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">16 April 1912 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">News of a great ship lost &mdash; <em>Titanic</em> sunk. London murmurs in doorways. By the river I thought of the Queen&rsquo;s steady hand on those summer days, and of the cost of neatness.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">5 September 1912 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">New post at Berry Bros. &amp; Rudd. Cellars like catacombs; ledgers older than I am. A small room off St James&rsquo;s &mdash; colder, but paid.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">14 October 1912 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Bought <em>The Girlhood of Queen Victoria</em> on credit. Turned the pages with a pounding heart. As expected, what the pencil forbade is absent. The pledge of silence is nowhere. What made it into the book is clean. The rest &mdash; what I hold &mdash; would strike like a hammer.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">3 November 1912 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">I cannot keep these papers. If found, I should be ruined. Yet to burn them feels like murder.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">22 November 1912 &mdash;</span>
          <span class="entry-text">Down in the cellars I slipped the twelve leaves into an archive marked <em>Miscellaneous Correspondence</em>. Between a sheaf of invoices and a letter about rum. No one will look there. I felt a pang, as if burying a friend.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <span class="entry-date">19 December 1912 &mdash;</span>
