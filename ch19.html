<p>The project manager had the practised calm of someone who spends their life negotiating with deadlines. We shook hands across a desk with a neat stack of barcodes in one corner and a roll of cotton tape in the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercer says you like anomalies,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don't like them,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I notice them. And I move them off other people's desks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do here?&rdquo; &ldquo;Three things,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;First, intake triage &mdash; catch misfiles before they burn hours. Second, metadata normalisation where it's cheapest. Third, a short &lsquo;miscellaneous&rsquo; protocol: anything that clearly doesn't belong gets logged, imaged, and routed; nothing walks, nothing vanishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Timeline?&rdquo; &ldquo;Two weeks on trial. If I'm not saving you time by day three, you cut me at close of play Friday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held my eye. &ldquo;Why do you want this?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because I like clean archives,&rdquo; I said, and let the silence do some of the heavy lifting. &ldquo;And because I'm good at making them cleaner, fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened a diary. &ldquo;We're taking <em>Miscellaneous Correspondence</em> upstairs next week,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you're still keen, start Monday. You'll shadow intake for a day, then sit on QC. Short contract, renewable. No heroics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No heroics,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Paper isn't impressed by them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We shook on it. In the corridor, the air felt different &mdash; cooler, like a door had been opened somewhere. If the twelve leaves were ever going to breathe again, it would be between a trolley and a cradle, under a camera, with three people talking about lunch in the next room.</p>
