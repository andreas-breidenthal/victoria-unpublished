    <p class="byline">Chapter 9</p>
    <div class="body-text">
<p>I started with the one fixed line I trusted: <em>The real cutting is elsewhere: the Household made to match the Whigs, the reliance on Melbourne named, the pledge of silence.</em></p>
<p>I opened the laptop. The screen cast a cold light. I typed: Bedchamber Crisis 1839.</p>
<p>The outline formed quickly. Melbourne resigns after a narrow Commons vote; Peel is sent for; he will take office only if the Queen replaces several Ladies of the Bedchamber &mdash; Whig kin &mdash; with women aligned to his party. The Queen refuses. Peel declines. Melbourne returns. A constitutional hinge disguised as a quarrel about rooms.</p>
<p>I thought of Ashcombe's twelve days in 1837 &mdash; the Household &ldquo;made to match the Whigs,&rdquo; the reliance named, the pledge of silence. Two years later, 1839, Peel demands a correction. If those earlier leaves exist &mdash; if they say what Ashcombe says they say &mdash; the Bedchamber row stops being a naivety tale about a young sovereign's feelings. It becomes a continuity problem: the 1837 formation is acknowledged in private and protected; the 1839 reformation is resisted in public. The symmetry is neat &mdash; and lethal.</p>
<p>I wrote it like a mechanic: June&ndash;July 1837: formation; Household complexion and instruction under Melbourne. May 1839: Bedchamber confrontation; Peel insists; Victoria refuses; Melbourne returns. 1841: an election settles it; Peel comes in; changes proceed.</p>
<p>I shut the browser. What am I chasing? Not gossip. A design choice at the start of a reign &mdash; how a court should look and what that look should do &mdash; and the later refusal to let someone else adjust the design. If Ashcombe's fragments are real, they don't just embarrass. They re-wire how the opening chapter is read.</p>
<p>And that is why Mercer is a problem. If he thinks I'm not hunting curios but fault lines, the meeting shifts from offers to containment. He will bring a velvet word and a soft box. Thursday is close.</p>
